    <h1 id="first">The Hysterical Herstory of Hysteria and How It Was Cured: From Ancient Times Until Now</h1>
    <p>Our story about how female bodies have been treated and mistreated over
      the centuries. Published to coincide with the exhibition: The Guerrilla Girls
      and La Barbe, at mfc-michèle didier, 9 September - 12 November 2016 in Paris.</p>
      <h1 id="second">The Guerrilla Girls' Art Museum Activity Book</h1>
      <p id= "second-p">Rich people have always had a lot of stuff. A few centuries ago, they
        ran out of room in their palaces and churches, so they started art museums.
        The Guerrilla Girls love museums and all the art in them, but we worry about
        them, too. Why do they raise hundreds of millions for new buildings, then
        complain that they don’t have enough money to buy art? Why do they blow a
        fortune on a single painting by a white male genius when they could acquire
        hundreds of great works by women and people of color instead? Why do museum
        store execs get paid more than curators?</p>
      <h1 id="third">The Guerrilla Girls' Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art</h1>
      <p id= "third-p">Take a romp through the last two thousand years of Western Art with the
        Guerrilla Girls as your guides. Find answers to questions like these:
        Who put all those naked men in the classical sections of museums? Why
        did nuns have more fun in medieval times? Did a girl have to cross dress
        for success in the 19th century? How far does a female have to go from her
        home to become an artist? Why were the modern Masters more interested in
        painting prostitutes than Suffragettes? Read about the fascinating lives
        of the women artists who were able to make it, despite incredible social
        obstacles and sexist art historians. Art history classes around the world
        are using it as a textbook.</p>
