    <h2>OUR STORY<h2>
        <p>The Guerrilla Girls are feminist activist artists. Over 55 people have been
          members over the years, some for weeks, some for decades. Our anonymity keeps
          the focus on the issues, and away from who we might be. We wear gorilla masks
          in public and use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose gender and ethnic
          bias as well as corruption in politics, art, film, and pop culture. We undermine
          the idea of a mainstream narrative by revealing the understory, the subtext, the
          overlooked, and the downright unfair. We believe in an intersectional feminism that
          fights discrimination and supports human rights for all people and all genders. We
          have done over 100 street projects, posters and stickers all over the world, including
          New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Mexico City, Istanbul, London, Bilbao, Rotterdam,
          and Shanghai, to name just a few. We also do projects and exhibitions at museums,
          attacking them for their bad behavior and discriminatory practices right on their
          own walls, including our 2015 stealth projection about income inequality and the
          super rich hijacking art on the façade of the Whitney Museum in New York. Our
          retrospectives in Bilbao and Madrid, Guerrilla Girls 1985-2015, and our US
          traveling exhibition, Guerrilla Girls: Not Ready To Make Nice, have attracted
          thousands. We could be anyone. We are everywhere. What’s next? More creative
          complaining!! New projects in London, Paris, Cologne, and more!</p>
